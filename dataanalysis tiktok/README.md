Tiktok Dataanalysis

This dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle listed about 19000 videos. Each video had variables named video duration, likes, comments etc..
I added each impression attribute (likes, comments, downloads, views) and used the sum for a new variable called impressions (see SQL file). After that I used Tableau to visualize some findings. My main goal was to find out, if the video length correlates with the impressions (see PNG files).
